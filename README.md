This little Bash tool will help you grab it, focus it, and bring it back to your main monitor â€“ like a digital lasso for rogue windows.

ðŸ›  Requirements
Make sure the following tools are installed:


```sudo apt install wmctrl```

```sudo apt install xdotool```

ðŸª› Example Output

ðŸ“‹ List of all visible and not windows :

 1. 0x02800005 -1 YourComuter Discord
 2. 0x04e00007  0 YourComuter MyLostWindow.pdf

ðŸ”§ Fixing window...

âœ… The window has been brought to focus and moved to the screen in fullsrceen.


âœ¨ Tip

Copy the script to a location in your $PATH, such as:

```cp fixer_window.sh /your/path``` (/usr/bin/ or ~/bin/fixer_window.sh)
```chmod +x fixer_window.sh```
Add a convenient alias to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
alias your_alias_name ='/your/path' (/usr/bin/ or ~/bin/fixer_window.sh)

```source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc```


Bind this script to a custom hotkey and summon your lost windows anytime with a single keystroke!
